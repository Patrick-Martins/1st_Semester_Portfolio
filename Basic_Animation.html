            <p class="assignment-text ">> This was the final Project for the Basic Animation theme, and personally, my favourite project of the whole semester. I really enjoyed working with my group, we decided to select the Monty Python and the Holy Grail movie to work on. Basically we had to create an interactive production that would promote the chosen movie and attract current audiences to watch it. <br>
            We started by signing a collaboration agreement, then we designed the moodboard, personas collage and style tile for our production. After that, we created the storyboard and started working straight away on the content for the story, some of us were responsible for the backgrounds and the other were responsible for designing the characters. When all the content was ready, we could then work on coding the interactive production. Finally, when we were satisfied with the solution, we conducted a peer review on it, done by our classmates,who actually fitted in our target-group. <br>
            At the end of the project we presented our final interactive production, based on a short and simple pdf.
