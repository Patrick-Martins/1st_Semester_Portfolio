This was accomplished by changing the style tile and developing a prototype on Adobe XD, that was later tested as a "trunk test" by fellow students from my class. All this process was documented on a pdf file that can be accessed by pressing the corresponding image. <br> To end this theme, I worked on making my website responsive and applied the design changes that were prototyped and tested on the previous assignment.</p>
