We created a process document, in which is presented all the work process during the 5 days of the Design Sprint, with the goal of developing a prototype mobile solution of Fronter.

            <p class="assignment-text "> This was the last assignment of the Semester. In groups, we had to create a mobile prototype solution that we thought would be helpful and convenient for students at KEA. The solution my group worked on consisted of an app where the user had access to the cantines and bars in all KEA buildings. <br> Since our long-term goal was to promote social-interaction between students at KEA, the app offered challenges (take a picture with a student from the international line and from the danish line, for example) in both the canteen and bar and, when completed, the student would be rewarded with a free coffee, a free beer or other offers available on the current week.
